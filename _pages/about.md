I have graduated from [Aston University](https://www.aston.ac.uk/) with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics (Hons). I would like to have a career in Data Science and Machine Learning where I can continue to practice software such as MATLAB, Python, Microsoft Excel, and others, which I learnt in my degree at university.
