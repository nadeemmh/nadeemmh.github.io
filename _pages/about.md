I have graduated from [Aston University](https://www.aston.ac.uk/) with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics (Hons). I chose to do a sandwich year during which I was given the opportunity to go to Germany and study in the presitigious [Technische Universität München (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/) where I studied Mechanical Engineering for a year. 

During my final year of university, I worked as a Student Ambassador for my university course where I helped first year students during seminars. I was also fortunate enough to get a part-time job as a Data Analyst (Intern) at Fakir Halal Donner where I used Jupyter (Python) to analyse and visualize data and deliver solutions in the form of professional reports, according to the company's business model. 

With my knowledge, skills, and experience, I would like to pursue a career in Data Science and Machine Learning where I can continue to practice software such as MATLAB, Python, R, and learn new and innovative techniques. Ultimately, my goal is to undertake a post graduate research degree (preferably PhD), and become a Research Scientist for a company/institution where I can help make a change in the world for problems such as climate change, poverty, energy, and medicine.
