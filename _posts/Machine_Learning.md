There are two main types of learning:
1) Supervised Learning
2) Unsupervised Learning

## 1) Supervised Learning 

What is Supervised Learning?
In supervised learning, a predictive model is developed based on both input data and output data. Classification refers to a supervised learning predictive modeling problem where a class label is predicted for a sample of input data. 

Example:
Examples of such problem include classifying whether a picture is a cat or a dog, handwriting characters, etc. Supervised learning also includes regression analysis which is used to predict a continuous outcome variable (y) based on the value or predictor variables (x). The goal of a regression model is to build a mathematical equation that defines y as a function of the x variables. An example of regression modelling is predicting prices of a house given the features of house like size, price, area, etc. In a supervised learning model, the algorithm learns on a labeled dataset, providing an answer key that the algorithm can use to evaluate its accuracy on training data.

Why Supervised Learning?
Supervised learning collects data and produces an output from previous experience. This allows for easy optimisation of performance and can result in better accuracy. Supervised learning algorithms can also help make predictions for new unseen data that we obtain later in the future.

## 2) Unsupervised Learning
What is Unsupervised Learning?
In unsupervised learning, groups (clusters) of data are created and only input data is interpreted. Here, the model to works on its own to discover information and mainly deals with the unlabelled data. Cluster analysis or clustering is an example of unsupervised learning where data is grouped in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. Other unsupervised learning algorithms include association, anomaly detection, neural networks, etc. 

Example:
Examples of unsupervised learning include clustering of DNA patterns to analyse evolutionary biology, human detection without knowledge of who is in the photo. A real-world example goes as follows; A friend invites you to his party where you meet totally strangers. Now you will classify them using unsupervised learning (no prior knowledge) and this classification can be on the basis of gender, age group, dressing, educational qualification or whatever way you would like. This learning is different from Supervised Learning since you didn't use any past/prior knowledge about people and classified them "on-the-go".

Why Unsupervised Learning?
Unsupervised learning finds many unknown patterns in data which can help in creating features which are useful for catergorisation. Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data which is very convenient since it is easier to get unlabeled data from a computer than labeled data, which requires manual intervention.
