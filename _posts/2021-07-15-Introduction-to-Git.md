This article focuses on understanding and using Git as a beginner to version control systems. 

Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System. Git is used to store content such as code and allows for changes to be made to files, so that there is a record of what has been done, and the user can revert to specific versions should they ever need to. 

## Key Words: 
- Control System: This means that Git is a content tracker. So Git can be used to store content — it is mostly used to store code due to the other features it provides.
- Version Control System: The code which is stored in Git keeps changing as more code is added, and many developers can add code in parallel. So Version Control System helps in handling this by maintaining a history of what changes have been made. Git also provides features like branches and merges, which will be covered later.
- Distributed Version Control System: Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local repository which is stored in the computer of each developer. This means that the code is not only stored in a central server, but the full copy of the code is also present in each user's computer. Git is a Distributed Version Control System since the code is present in every developer’s computer.

## Why Version Control Systems like Git are needed:
- Team projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So a version control system like Git is needed to ensure there are no conflicts in the code between the developers.
- Requirements in such projects change often. So a version control system allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of the code.
- Several projects which are being run in parallel involve the same codebase. In such a case, the concept of branching in Git is very important.
