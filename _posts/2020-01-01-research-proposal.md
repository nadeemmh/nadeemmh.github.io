## Introduction
The incorporation of machine learning into clinical medicine holds promise for substantially
improving health care delivery by pairing technology with the overwhelming amounts of
data being transmitted on a daily basis. Enabling data to be accessed remotely, in ways such
as blood pressure monitoring devices for patients, has allowed research to accelerate, and the
large data sets allow for more consistent and credible evaluations.

The techniques used for this project focus heavily on machine learning and how large volumes
of data can be processed to learn complex patterns about individual patients as well
as the conditions they suffer from. These machine learning algorithms are used to determine
characteristics such as classification and clustering. In addition to this, data-based estimation
methods in network science, such as recurrent neural networks will be implemented, as well
as components of probabilistic modelling methods.

The primary aim for applying the machine learning algorithms that will be used in this
study is to support the physical well-being of patients with conditions such as dementia,
Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s, etc. By analysing raw observations and measurement data
alongside environmental data, collected from hospitals and portable person monitoring devices,
the data can be condensed and sorted in a manner where patterns can be found in the
behaviour of the patients and the progress of their underlying conditions.

## 2 Aims and Objectives
The overall aim of this study is to find a novel approach using data-driven techniques for
pattern visualization in continuous person monitoring applications. This means developing
new and innovative techniques for data mining and finding patterns in data collected through
human monitoring. This will be done through the development of creative machine learning
ideas and techniques.

The specific objectives are:

-To identify new data-driven techniques for analysing patterns that are generated in
health applications through continuous person monitoring.

- Using recent advances in data-driven statistical machine learning models, find a new
ways to adapt to constraints and drawbacks.

- Analysing the data and patterns to gain a better understanding of what observations to
focus on.

- To acknowledge applications of the research and adjust to the needs of participants accordingly.

- Understanding the patterns in data and being able to convey these results to clinicians
and/or other medical professionals so that they can provide better care for patients.

In a project of this calibre, there are important questions that must be asked, such as:

- What are all the variables that will be measured to achieve the study outcomes? How
will these variables be measured?

- What are the limitations of the methods, and what can be done to minimize these limitations?
